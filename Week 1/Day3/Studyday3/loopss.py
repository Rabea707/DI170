#loops is python are very weird 
#for <variable_name> in <sequence_name>:
    #CODE
    #CODE

#example
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi', 'pear']

for fruit in fruits:
  print(fruit)
  
cities = ["London", "San Francisco", "Paris", "Barcelona"]

for city in cities:
    print("I once went to", city)

numbers = range(0,15) #this will print from 0-14 and not 15!! it doesnt include the last numb
for num in numbers:
   print(num)

for numms in range(10): # 0-9 = 10 numbers
   print(numms)

for numms in range(10,20,2): # (10, 20,2) skips 2 
   print(numms)
